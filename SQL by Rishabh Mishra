SQL is a programming language used to intract with Database.

Why SQL is used?
Its used for CRUD
C - Create
R - Read
U - Update
D - Delete

What is database?
Its a system that allow users to store and organise data.

Why database is used?
Its use to store, manupulate, or to access the data.

Video 2: Data Types, Primary-Foreign Keys & Constraints in SQL | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 2

Data Types:
- Data type of a column defines what type of value the column can store in the table.
- Its defined while creating tables in database.
- Data types mainly classified into three categories + most used -
  > String: char, varchar, etc
  > Numeric: int, float, bool, etc
  > Date & Time: date, datetime, etc

Commonly used data types in SQL:
 > int: used for integer values
 > float: used to specify a decimal point number
 > bool: used to specify boolean values true and false
 > char: fixed length string that can contain numbers, letters, and special characters
 > varchar: variable length string that can contain numbers, letters, and special characters 
 > date: date formate YYYY-MM-DD
 > datetime: date and time combination, formate is YYYY-MM-DD hh:mm:ss

Primary Key:
> It is a unique column we set in a table to easily identify and locate data in queries
> A table can have only one primary key which should be unique and Not Null.

Foreign Key:
> It is  a column used to link two or more tables together.
> A table can have any number of foreign keys, can contains duplicates and not null values.


Constraints:
> It is Use to specify rules for data in a table
> This ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table 
> Constraints can be specified when the table is created with the CREATE TABLE statement, or
> After the table is created with the ALTER TABLE statement

Syntax:
Create table table_name (
column1 datatype constraint,
column2 datatype constraint,
column3 datatype constraint,
.....
);

Commonly used Constraints in SQL:
> NOT NULL: Ensures that a column can not have a NULL value
> UNIQUE: Ensures that all values in a column are unique
> Primary Key: A combination of a NOT NULL and UNIQUE
> Foreign Key: Privent actions that would destroy links between tables (use to link multiple table together)
> CHECK: Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition
> DEFAULT: Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified
> CREATE INDEX: Use to create and retrieve data from the database very quickly

Video 3: Create Table In SQL & Create Database | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 3

Create a database:
> create database testdb;

Create a table:

The create table statement is used to create a new table in a database

Syntax: 
> create table testtb 
(
ID int primary key,
Name varchar(30) Not Null,
Age int Not Null,
City char(25),
Salary int
);

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Video 4: INSERT UPDATE, DELETE & ALTER Table in SQL With Example | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 4

# INSERT values in Table:

The insert into statement is used to insert new records in a table.

Syntax:
Insert into table_name (column1, column2, column3, ....columnN) values (value1, value2, value3,....valueN);

eg:
Insert into customer (custID, custName, Age, City, Salary) values (1, 'Prakash', 27, 'Bangalore', 560037);

# UPDATE values in Table:
The UPDATE command is used to update existing rows in a table.

Syntax:
UPDATE table_name 
set 'column_name1' = 'value1', 'column_name2' = 'value2'
where 'ID'= 'value';

eg:
UPDATE customer 
set 'CustName' = 'Sam', 'Age' = '29'
where 'CustID'= '79100';


# Delete values from Table:

The DELETE statement is used to delete existing records from a table.

Syntax:
DELETE from table_name where condition;

eg:
DELETE from customer where CustID = 79100;

# ALTER values from Table:

The ALTER TABLE statement is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table

Syntax:
> ALTER Table - ADD Column Syntax
Alter table table_name
Add column column_name;

> ALTER Table - DROP Column Syntax
Alter table table_name
Drop column column_name;

> ALTER Table - Alter/Modify Column Syntax
Alter table table_name
Alter column column_name data_type;


# DROP and Truncate Table:
> The DROP table command deletes a table from in the database.

Syntax:
DROP TABLE table_name;

> The TRUNCATE TABLE command deletes the datainside a table, but not the table itself.

Syntax:
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name;


---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Video 5: SELECT Statement & WHERE Clause with Example | Operators in SQL | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 5

# SELECT Statement:
> The SELECT statement used to select data from a database.

Syntax:
- select * from table_name;     -- to select all columns from the table
- select column_name from table_name;    -- to select particular columns from the table
- select column1, column2 from table_name; 

- select distinct column_name from table_name; -- to select distinct/unique values from particular columns of the table


# WHERE Statement:
> The WHERE clause used to filter records.
> It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.

Syntax:
- select column_name from table_name where conditions;

eg: 
select name from classroom where grade = "A";


Queries used:

ðŸ‘‰ Customer Table

CREATE TABLE customer
(
CustID int8 PRIMARY KEY,
CustName varchar(50) NOT NULL,
Age int NOT NULL,
City char(50),
Salary numeric );

INSERT INTO customer (CustID, Custhame, Age, City, Salary)
VALUES
(1, â€˜samâ€™, 26, â€˜Delhiâ€™, 9008),
(2, â€˜Ramâ€™, 19, â€˜Bangaloreâ€™, 11000),
(3, â€˜Pamâ€™, 31, â€˜Mumbaiâ€™, 6060),
(4, â€˜3amâ€™, 42, â€˜Puneâ€™, 10000);


ðŸ‘‰ Classroom Table

CREATE TABLE classroom (
rollno int8 PRIMARY KEY,
name varchar(50) NOT NULL,
house char(12) NOT NULL,
grade char(1) );

INSERT INTO classroom (rollno, name, house, grade)
VALUES
(1, â€˜Samâ€™, â€˜Akashâ€™, â€˜Bâ€™),
(2, â€˜Ramâ€™, â€˜Agniâ€™, â€˜Aâ€™),
(3, â€˜Shyamâ€™, â€˜Jalâ€™, â€™Bâ€™),
(4, â€˜Sundarâ€™, â€˜Agniâ€™, â€™Aâ€™),
(5, â€˜Ramâ€™, â€˜Yayuâ€™, â€˜Bâ€™);

# Operators in SQL 
> The SQL reserved words & characters are called operators which are used with WHERE clause in a SQL query.

- Most used operators
1. Arithmetic Operators: Used for arithmetic operations on numeric values
eg - Addition(+), Substraction(-), Multiplication(*), Division(/),Modulas(%)

2. Comperision Operators: Used to compare two different data of SQL table.
eg - Equal(=), Not Equal(!=), Greater Then(>), Greater Then Equals To (=>)

3. Logical Operators: Used to perform boolean operations
eg - ALL, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE, AND, OR, NOT, ANY

4. Bitwise Operators: Used to perform the bit operations on the integer values
eg - Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise OR(|)


# LIMIT Clause:
> The LIMIT clause is used to set and upper limit on the number of tuples returned by SQL query.
eg - select column_name from table_name limit 5; -- will limit the query result to 5 records

# ORDER BY Clause:
The ORDER BY is used to sort the result in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order 
eg - select column_name from table_name order by column_name ASC; 
eg - select column_name from table_name order by column_name DESC;

Video 7: String Functions in SQL | Functions in SQL | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 7

# Functions in SQL:
> The functions in SQL are the database objects that contains a set of SQL statements to perform a specific task. 
A function accepts input parameters, perform actions and then return the result.

> Types of Functions:
1. System Defined Functions: These are the built-in functions.
eg - rand(), round(), upper(), lower(), count(), sum(), max(), etc.

2. User Defined Functions: Once you define a function it can call it in the same way as the built-in functions.

# The Most used string functions:
> The string functions are used to perform an operation on input string and return and output string.
- UPPER(): converts the value of a field to uppercase.
- LOWER(): converts the value of a field to lowercase.
- LENGTH(): return the length of the value in a text field.
- SUBSTRING(): extracts a substring from a string.
- NOW(): returns the current system data & time.
- FORMAT(): used to set the format of a field.
- CONCAT(): add two or more strings together.
- REPLACE(): replaces all occurences of a substring within the a string, with a new substring.
- TRIM(): removes leading and trailing spaces (or other specified characters) from a string.

> select upper (first_name) from customer;
> select upper (first_name), first_name from customer;

> select lower (first_name) from customer;
> select lower (first_name), first_name from customer;

> select length (first_name) from customer;
> select length (first_name), first_name  from customer;

> select substring (first_name, 1, 3)  from customer;
> select substring (first_name, 1, 3), first_name  from customer;
> select substring (first_name, 2, 4), first_name  from customer;

> select concat(first_name,last_name) from customer;
> select concat(first_name,last_name), first_name, last_name from customer;


> SELECT TRIM(' ' FROM '   Hello, World   '); -- Output: 'Hello, World'  -- Remove spaces from both ends of the string
> SELECT TRIM(LEADING 'a' FROM 'aabbacat'); -- Output: 'bbacat'          -- Remove 'a' from the beginning of the string
> SELECT TRIM(TRAILING 'z' FROM 'pizzaazzz'); -- Output: 'pizzaa'        -- Remove 'z' from the end of the string

Video 8: Aggregate Functions in SQL - COUNT, SUM, AVG, MAX, MIN | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 8

# Aggregate Functions:
> The aggregate functions performs a calculation on multiple values and returns a single value.
> Aggregate functions are often used with GROUP BY and SELECT statement

# The Most used aggregate functions:
- COUNT(): returns number of values
- SUM(): returns sum of values
- AVG(): returns average of values
- MAX(): returns maximum value
- MIN(): returns minimum value
- ROUND(): rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places

Syntax with eg:
> select count(*) from payments;
> select count(amount) from payments;

> select sum(amount) from payments;

> select avg(amount) from payments;

> select max(amount) from payments;

> select min(amount) from payments;

> select round(avg(amount),2) from payments;

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Video 9: Group By and Having Clause in SQL | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 9

# GROUP BY Statement
> The GROUP BY statement group rows that have same values into summery rows.
> It is often used with aggregate functions(count(), sum(), avg(), min(), max()) to group the result-set by one or more columns.

Syntax:
select column_name from table_name group by column_name;

eg:
select mode, sum(amount) as total from payment group by mode.

select mode, sum(amount) as total from payment group by mode order by total asc;

# HAVING Clause:
> The HAVING clause is used to apply a filter on the result of GROUP BY based on the specified conditions.
> The WHERE clause places conditions on the selected columns, where the HAVING clause places conditions on the group created by the GROUP BY clause.

Syntax:
select column_name(s) from table_name where condition(s) group by column_name(s) having condition(s);

eg:
select mode, count(amount) 
as total from payment
group by mode
having count (amount) > = 3
order by total desc;

select mode, count(amount) 
as total from payment
group by mode
having count (amount) > = 2 and count (amount) < 4  
order by total desc;

- Order of execution
SELECT(columns/everything) FROM(Table name)
WHERE(Apply condition)
GROUP BY(Columns name you want to group) AS (Column header name)
HAVING(apply condition) [For more condition use OPERATORS]
ORDER BY (Column header name with ASC/DESC)
LIMIT(Count of rows you want)

The correct order of exection is:
1. FROM
2. WHERE
3. GROUP BY
4. HAVING
5. SELECT
6. ORDER BY
7. LIMIT

The difference between the having and where clause in SQL is that the where clause cannot be used with aggregates function, but the having clause can

Video 11: Complete SQL JOINS For Beginners | SQL JOIN Queries with Examples | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 11

# SQL JOIN:
> A JOIN clause is used to combine data from two or more tables, based on a related column between them.

Types of JOINS:
> INNER JOIN
> LEFT JOIN also called as Left Outer Join
> RIGHT JOIN also called as Right Outer Join
> Full JOIN also called as Full Outer Join

# INNER JOIN: 
> Returns records that have matching values in both tables.

Syntax:
select from coulumn_name from table_nameA INNER JOIN table_nameB on table_nameA.column_name = table_nameB.column_name

eg:
select * from customer as c inner join payment as p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id;

# LEFT JOIN:
> Returns all records from the left table, and matched records from the right table.

Syntax:
select from coulumn_name from table_nameA LEFT JOIN table_nameB on table_nameA.column_name = table_nameB.column_name

eg:
select * from customer as c left join payment as p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id;

# RIGHT JOIN:
> Returns all the records from the right table and matched records from the left table.

Syntax:
select from coulumn_name from table_nameA RIGHT JOIN table_nameB on table_nameA.column_name = table_nameB.column_name

eg:
select * from customer as c right join payment as p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id;


# Full JOIN:
> Returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table.

## We do not have a full join or full outer join in MySQL. But instead, we will emulate them using a combination of LEFT and RIGHT JOINS and the UNION query.

Syntax:
select from coulumn_name from table_nameA FULL OUTER JOIN table_nameB on table_nameA.column_name = table_nameB.column_name     -- not applicable in MySQL

SELECT * FROM t1 LEFT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id
UNION
SELECT * FROM t1 RIGHT JOIN t2 ON t1.id = t2.id

eg:
select * from customer as c full outer join payment as p on c.customer_id = p.customer_id;

SELECT * FROM Students s LEFT JOIN Marks m ON s.Id = m.StudentID
UNION
SELECT * FROM Students s RIGHT JOIN Marks m ON s.Id = m.StudentID
WHERE s.Id IS NULL;

Video 12: SQL SELF JOIN | UNION & UNION ALL in SQL | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 12

# SELF JOIN: 
> a SELF JOIN is a regular joinin which a table is joined to itself.
> SELF JOINs are powerful for comparing values in a column of rows with the same table.

Syntax:
select column_name from table_nameA as t1 join table_nameA as t2 on t1.column_name = t2.column_name;

eg:
select t1.empname as employee_name, t2.empname as manger_name from emp as t1 
JOIN
emp as t2 on t2.empid = t1.manager_id;


# UNION: 
> The sql UNION clause/operator is used to combine/concatinate the results of two or more select statements without returning any duplicate rows and keep unique records.

To use this UNION clause, each SELECT statement must have 
- The same number of columns selected and expressions 
- The same data type and 
- Have them in the same order

## UNION only returns unique set of records from the tables.

Syntax:
select column_name from table_nameA
UNION
select column_name from table_nameB;

eg:
select cust_name,cust_amount from custA
UNION
select cust_name,cust_amount from custB;

# UNION ALL: 
> In UNION ALL everything is same as UNION, it combines/concatinate two or more table but keeps all records including duplicates.

Syntax:
select column_name from table_nameA
UNION ALL
select column_name from table_nameB;

eg:
select cust_name,cust_amount from custA
UNION ALL
select cust_name,cust_amount from custB;

Video 13: Complete SQL Subquery Using Comparison and Logical Operators | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 13

# SUB QUERY:
> A Subquery or inner query or a nested query allows us to create complex query on the output of another query.
> A Subquery syntax involves two SELECT statements.

Syntax:
select column_name from table_name where column_name operator;
> select column_name from table_name where column_name operator;

eg:
select * from payment where amount > (select avg(amount) from payment);

select customer_id, amount, mode from payment where customer_id IN (select customer_id from customer);

select first_name, last_name  from customer as c
where exists ( select customer_id, amount from payment as p where p.customer_id = c.customer_id and amount > 100);

Video 14: SQL Window Function with Example- RANK, DENSE RANK, ROW NUMBER, LEAD/LAG | SQL Tutorial in Hindi 14

# WINDOWS FUNCTIONS: 
> WINDOWS FUNCTIONs applies aggregate, ranking, and analytic functions over a particular window (set of rows).
> And OVER clause is used with window functions to define that window.

Syntax:
select column_name, fun() over([<partition by clause>]
[<order by clause>]
[<row or range clause>])
from table_name;

WINDOW FUNCTION TERMS:

> Window function -- applies aggregate, ranking and analytic functions over a particular window for eg. SUM, AVG, or row_number.
> Expression -- is the name of column that we want the window function operated on. this may not be necessary depending on what window function is used.
> Over --is just to signify that this is a window function.
> Partition By -- divides the rows into partitions so we can specify which rows to use to compute the window function.
> Order By -- is used so that we can order the rows within each partition. this is optional and does not have to be specified.
> Rows -- can be used if we want to further limit the rows within our partition. this is optional and usually not used.

# Types of Window Functions:
>> Aggregate - SUM
             - AVG
             - COUNT
             - MIN
             - MAX
             
>> Ranking   - ROW_NUMBER
             - RANK
